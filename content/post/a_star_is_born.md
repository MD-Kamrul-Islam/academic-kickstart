## Movie Breakdown
The thing that always peeks interest in the ‘A Star is Born’ franchise is how different directors adds their own version of flesh and skins to the constant skeleton of the plot. While every cinephiles has their own favorite iteration, most of them have already deemed Copper’s version as the best in the franchise. Following the surge of wide acclamations after the trailer release, the movie definitely lived up to its expectation snatching a spot in the already star-studded nominee line up for the best picture academy award. 
Bradley Cooper takes up a huge responsibility to perform both behind and in front of the camera. Cooper plays the role of Jackson “Jack” Maine, a (in)famous country rock musician who is hardly staying relevant in the scene with his heavy drinking problem and hearing issue due to Tinnitus. Ally Campana, played by Lady Gaga is a drag club singer (only for the sake of her love towards singing) “with a voice like from heaven”, as her father Lorenzo (Andrew Dice Clay) so eloquently put. On a fated night, when Jack was returning from a concert, he stumbled up on the drag club’s door looking for more booze where Ally used to perform after her waitress shift ended.  Hearing the beautiful rendition of ‘La Vie en Rose’ from place he least expected and from a person who kept on hypnotizing Jack from her attire to her performance, Jack asks her out for the night; wasted in booze and the trance created by Ally. The night is one of the beautifully executed scenes by Cooper which not only gives Jack’s character a depth but also successfully lays the ground work for the two leads’ initial courtship. 

Assuming that last night was the last time she would meet Jack, Ally was in disbelief when she found out that Jack arranged the song, she sang to Jack last night in a live concert (This is the 2019 Best Original Song Academy award winning song “Shallow”). The scene is very well executed with the personal up-close shots and the revved-up crowds in the background.  Ally was overwhelmed with emotions with the huge appreciations from the crowd and also grateful to Jack for the opportunity. Hence, Ally decides to tag along with Jack, remaining a part of his band, but more than that, staying as a safe harbor where Jack can anchor his life from drowning in the ocean of alcohol. Unsurprisingly, soon enough Ally’s stardom skyrockets whereas Jack fears of losing her in the world of camera flashes. Jack’s drinking problem and Tinnitus only facilitates his already dimming career.
Cooper’s most successful triumph in his directorial debut might perhaps be how he gave the male lead a proper character development (some might argue that is because he, himself takes on the lead role), to an extent which compels the audience to forget that Jack is not one of them, rather he is a superstar. Bradley Cooper brings out one of the best performances of his career where you can not but shed tears to a story that you knew from minute one how it was going to unfold. 
As if it was not enough to cast true-life musicians such as Lady Gaga (also Lukas Nelson behind the mic), the crew went an extra mile by singing some of the movie’s songs in actual music festivals. The opening scene where Jack is seen to be performing “Maybe It’s Time” was actually shot at the 2017 edition of this country music blowout in Indio, Calif (Stagecoach Festival). The crew also invaded the Glastonbury Festival and Coachella for two other concert scenes.

The movie has a powerful cast who seizes their character with authority to convince the audience how Jack wounded up at such low point from his initial stardom. Bobby, played by Sam Elliot, gives a noteworthy performance as Jack’s elder brother. One of the finest scenes in the movie is where, after an emotional monologue from Jack, Bobby just wordlessly drives away from Jack to showcase the ferocity of the brother’s love and pain. Among others, Dave Chappelle, Anthony Ramos, Rafi Gavron, Andrew Dice Clay played crucial roles in the movie to make it the success that it is.
Even after the strong production, critically acclaimed music pieces and sublime acting from both the leads and others, the movie fails to keep the audience glued to the screen. Part of this is owing to the fact that the story stays true its previous versions structurally giving no scopes to the audience to ponder what’s going to happen next. But, as the second half of the movie starts to roll, the dearth of experience from Bradley Cooper’s side as director is evident. The movie gradually starts to lose its pace and the movie has little to add on the fickle nature of the showbiz which has better articulations in past movies.
The journey behind the camera for Bradley Cooper has only just begun and it is certainly too soon to start judging him. But all in all, Cooper does a fairly good job on the chair in the movie industry he has never sat on. Cooper brought a modern version of “A Star is Born” along with Will Fetters and Eric Roth, where for the first time in all four iterations the male lead is portrayed to be a sympathetic character. The depth shown in the character of Jackson Maine is truly admirable (again, I cannot help pointing out how brilliant Bradley Cooper was on playing this role) and this is the primary reason why the audience needs to keep a pack of tissue close by even though they already know how the story is going to go down. In addition, Cooper has a done more than a decent job in the recording room as well despite his lack of professional singing background. The music pieces themselves are enough to compel you to drive to the theatres to listen them in enhanced audio quality. I may speak for most, if not all people who watched the movie, that the only regret after watching this movie would be that, we could not see Cooper and Gaga perform a second time duet of “Shallow” in the 134-minute runtime.
