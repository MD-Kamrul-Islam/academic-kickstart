# Introduction
In the ongoing era of modernization and digitalization, sports is not bound only to the physical places, they are going beyond the fields and grounds to the virtual realm. That is where, the word E-Sports came. Electronic sports, a virtual space created through programming and graphic designing that allows players (individuals playing the game) to explore the virtual world and carry out the tasks assigned to them in the game. Even though computer games and other console-based gaming were popular since 1990s, E-Sports became a phenomenon only after it became a shared platform where multiple players can play the same game at the same time. Games like LoL (League of Legends), CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Operations), DotA (Defense of the Ancients) are one of the pioneers in this online multiplayer gaming industry. As a fellow DotA player and enthusiast for over 5 years, I have devoted quite a lot of effort in trying to be one of the stars in the game, someone who is recognized all throughout the gaming community. As I still keep that dream kindled inside of me, I look up to the most accomplished DotA player ever in the game, a player who was thrown into a corner by his best friend, a human who believed in the power of friendship, but most importantly, a leader who took a team of nobodies and walked side by side with them in the greatest stage of them all, TI (The International) and concurred it – twice. He is the leader that I look up to, his name is Johan "N0tail" Sundstein.

# The Story of Johan “N0tail” Sundstein
Johan was born on 8th of October 1993 in Denmark. Starting his early gaming career in HoN (Heroes of Newerth), Johan switched to DotA at the age of 15 where he met with Tal “Fly” Aizik, who later went on to be his best friend and bitter rival. Johan was already catching the eyes of sponsors for the game with his flamboyant playstyle and micromanagement skills. Just at the age of 17, he was invited to lead a team of 4 fresh-bloods just like him. The newly formed ‘Team Fnatic’ almost immediately began to achieve wins in online tournaments and along with the team Johan’s in game skills and popularity in the community skyrocketed. 

As Johan was cruising through his DotA career with multiple championship under his belt, two things remained the same: his love for the game DotA and the bond he once made with Tal “Fly” Aizik. Despite being on two rival teams, their bond of friendship never seemed to waver. The duo was known as the two brothers in arms in DotA. Both were achieving success with their respective teams, but the new generation gamers in the game were stepping up. As time progressed, the once skillful Johan was losing his touch in terms of gaming reaction skills, but his knowledge of the game was better than anyone. 

At 2015, Johan decided to form his very own team. And who better to team up with than his very best friend, Tal. Hence Team OG, came into being, recruiting one of the hottest free agents on the pro scene and with a blend of experience and fresh-blood Team OG looked promising in the papers. And they delivered. Team OG crushed their opponents in each and every tournament, the DotA community was jumping on the OG hype train as they claimed two Majors Titles, The Frankfurt Major and The Manilla Major. But as the 2015-2016 season was coming to an end, it was time for the biggest dream for a DotA player, The International.

Team OG, one of the hot favorites to win the coveted Title of the Aegis along with the 8-million-dollar prize pool, geared up to play at the grandest stage of them all. But, the OG who shined bright like a star all throughout the season, seemed lackluster in their performance, and was eliminated only through the 2nd round of the event. The blow was a massive one, for all of Team OG, 3/5th of the team decided to disband. Johan and Tal stayed at Team OG, as they still believed in each other and the power of friendship. They formed a new team, similar to the old one, a blend of fresh-blood and experience. Johan’s leadership skills were proven once again when this team also took the DotA scene by storm winning title after titles and achieving the incredible feat of winning 4 Major Titles in DotA, a landmark yet to be concurred. But, no matter how hard they strived, the coveted Aegis still eluded them as they secured a disheartening 7-8th finish at TI.

2017-2018 season was the lowest point of Team OG and needlessly to say in Johan’s and Tal’s career. The team was in shambles, losing tournaments one after another, the team morale took a downright nosedive, but Johan trusted in his teammates as he always believed that, the power of love and friendship is the strongest bond there is and only those who has that can achieve true success. As OG seemed to head towards TI with the least expectation in 3 years, a transfer news left the whole community dumbfounded. Right before 2 months of TI, Tal left OG with one of its accomplished players to one of the most prominent team at that time, Evil Geniuses (EG). Tal who Johan knew from the time he started his DotA career, for well over 8 years, who Johan considered as a brother, backstabbed him in the back in the most awful of ways and left Team OG in ruins. Johan was on the verge of quitting DotA, but he grinded his teeth and he decided that he will show up on the stage of TI and he will have his shot at redemption. With just two months in hand, Johan could only manage a few rookie players. Critics and community were skeptical that this team wouldn’t even mange to qualify for TI, but against all odds, Johan qualified for TI with Team OG. They played every match in the main stage as the underdogs, every person watching thought that this is the end of their journey on each match, but somehow OG found a way each of those times when they were doubted. And, it was nothing less than a fairy tale when Johan lifted the Aegis and the lion share of the 15 million dollar prize pool, with a team that was formed only 2 months ago, a team who had players who previously didn’t win any tournaments, a team that was built only on the base of trust and foresight of Johan “N0tail” Sundstein.

The story does not end here, it continues to the 2018-2019 TI, where with the same line-up, Team OG lifts the Aegis once again, becoming the only team in 9 years of DotA to lift the aegis of champions twice. Johan went down in the history book as the greatest captain and leader of all time.

# Foibles of the Greatest DotA Player Ever

Johan is undoubtedly the best captain ever to lead a DotA team. However, he is a leader who is passionate about the game and trusts his teammates to the end of the world. As a leader, he does not wear the iron fist to dictate his teammates. The fact that his best friend Tal left with another player, and he never saw it coming proves how blindly he trusted them. Johan throughout his DotA career played a selfless game, always doing what’s better for the team, rather than him as a player. But this mindset was the sole reason why he was on the verge of quitting the game that gave him so much in life. This mindset worked like a double-edged sword, putting him at one of the lowest points in his life and afterwards lifting him at the peak of success in the DotA world.

# The Tale is Not Over Yet

Johan is not retiring anytime soon and neither is Team OG putting up their gauntlets. They are gearing up for the next edition of TI on 2020. Team OG has started their very own channel to teach new DotA players on how to play the game and telling them to enjoy the game with their friends. Team OG is a burning example of the fact that, you don’t need to sack your loved ones to achieve greatness, you can reach that height with trust, love and ‘The Power of Friendship’. When asked, “Who were the persons that came into your mind when you were lifting the trophy?”, all the players were thanking their families and their loved ones. Johan did the same, he also mentioned his family and loved ones, he replied, “All six (OG team members and the coach) of them were with me”
