## Introduction

“What do you find in these make-believe characters that you cannot seem to live without, even for one day?” – *silence*
“How can you sit for hours without a care about the world and stare at the monitor like that?” – *silence*
“When will you stop being a child and act like a more grown up and stop playing video games?” – “Never”
A frequent, if not daily, fiasco a gamer has to endure, either from their parents or spouse. Our choices on games genres, developers and gameplay might vary, but the unifying love scattered across hundreds of millions of gamers and the communities across internet is something we can boast about any day of the week.

Being a passionate DOTA 2 player, it’s hard for me to manage time to devote into the latest open worlds and RPGs. But looking back, they once were the only type of games I would be invested in. Even to this day “Devil May Cry 4” is installed in my PC, a game from which I created my gaming name, “twin_funeral”. I even drew two swords resembling the Rebellion & Yamato.

If anyone asked the 7-year old me, back when he was tapping the left and right arrow key in “3D Pinball – Space Cadet”, “Would you be interested in a strategy game?”, It would most probably result in a rude rejection for disturbing in my crusade to beat the high score set by my older brother. My love towards video games grew little by little through playing Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (aka Mustapha), Hercules, ROAD RASH and other classics.

As I stepped in my teens, I got to hear about this awesome game called “Assassins Creed 2”. Out of curiosity, I borrowed the disks from a friend and I was mesmerized. After that, I was unstoppable, completing games after games, gossiping about the plots and the action scenes and gloating how easy it was to defeat the evil bosses which they had so much trouble defeating (I lied!). My favorite gaming genre was fictional actions (Devil May Cry, Darksiders, Mass Effect series to name a few).
One day, I discovered I was a natural in FIFA as I dribbled past my friend in my first ever multiplayer game and scored 5 goals while receiving none. After that my new addiction was going to friends’ house or inviting them to mine and arranging FIFA tournaments. FIFA addiction continued till I met my current love DOTA 2 at around when I was 15. Unfortunately, unlike my former loves, DOTA 2 didn’t allow me to cheat on her!


## Changing Habits 

The changing habits in video games genre as we grow up is no anomaly. It’s backed up by data as well. A recently published paper on changing gaming habits by Quantic Foundry found that competitiveness in human nature takes a gradual nosedive as they age.

Nonetheless, the generic belief which is, older people like strategy games more than young people, proved to be false by this report.

If I take a moment to think about all the games I played and all the friends I made along the way, I spot a lot of faces. As my gaming genre became more diverse, my friend list expanded. The ones who hooked me up with Assassins Creed and Devil May Cry, some of them are now playing CS:GO, some are into the latest RPGs and some are streaming their own live gameplay. It’s kind of hard to digest how much we have digressed from our original root games. But then again, change is what makes the world around us less boring!

## Throne at Jeopardy

Game developers keep focusing on young gamers, while the android games have been growing bigger day by day. The easy access on tabs and smartphones, even while travelling, has made android gaming maybe a close if not equivalent rival for console game developers. Nintendo, Ubisoft, BioWare, CAPCOM and the others need to come up with a few bunnies from their hats to maintain their dominance in the industry.

## The Choice

{{< figure src="/img/The choice.jpg" title="Choice" numbered="true" lightbox="true" width="50%">}}

I started with saying that “I will never stop being a child and act like a grown up, if it comes at the cost of video games”. Sadly, life tends to meddle with our wishes more often than seldom. I see a lot of my ‘once gaming nerd’ older brothers, in their list of priorities video games couldn’t make the cut. Sure, they go to movies and concerts, but video games? It’s the one that can be kicked to the curb. There is no telling that I wouldn’t trade off video games for ‘responsibilities’ if and when the times come. But I for one believe that life is too short to have regrets, and even shorter to think about the future regrets. Therefore, my gaming brothers and sisters, I urge upon thee, “Live fully, Laugh uncontrollably and Game gleefully. If you die, you will eventually respawn!”
Agree with my opinion? How have your gaming habits changed as you evolved through time? Let me know!
